PaDiM: a Patch Distribution Modeling Framework for Anomaly Detection and Localization  
    Code is based on https://github.com/Pangoraw/PaDiM  
    Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08785  

Implementation of Sub-Image Anomaly Detection with Deep Pyramid Correspondences (SPADE)  
    Code is based on https://github.com/byungjae89/SPADE-pytorch/tree/master  
    Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.02357
